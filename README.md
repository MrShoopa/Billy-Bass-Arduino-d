# Billy Bass Arduino'ed

Based on Donald Bell's Instructable.

"Hey man, why is your fish singing Mariachi in 3 the morning?"


Make your Billy Bass Fish (or any animatronic with some DC motors) react to external sound!


Using an Arduino paired with an Adafruit Motor Shield (v2),
this code determines the toy's active movement based on the strength of audio provided by a connected audio jack.


Featuring:

  -Ability to change threshold for audio strength required to move each motor

  -Added support for some Billy Bass models with a third body motor

  -Head movement based on idle audio input

  -More to hopefully come!
